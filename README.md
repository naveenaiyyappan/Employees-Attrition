# Employees-Attrition
## INTRODUCTION:
          Employee attrition refers to an employee’s voluntary or involuntary resignation from a workforce.
Organizations spend many resources in hiring talented employees and training them. Every employee is critical to a company’s success. 
My goal was to predict employee attrition and identify the factors contributing to an employee leaving a workforce.
We also analyzed the dataset to identify key factors contributing to an employee leaving a workforce. 
Our project will assist organizations in gaining fresh insights into what drives attrition and thus enhance retention rate.

## IMPORT LIBRARIES
  1)  import pandas as pd
  2)  import numpy as np
  3)  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  4)  import seaborn as sns
  5)  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
  6)  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  7)  import statsmodels.api as sm
  8)  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  9)  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
 10)  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,ConfusionMatrixDisplay
 11)  from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
 12)  import plotly. express as px
 13)  import dash
 14)  import dash_html_components as html
 15)  import dash_core_components as dcc

## METHODOLGY
1)  Data preprocessing
2)  Check duplicate values in dataset
3)  Catergorical columns
4)  Numerical columns
5)  Create a plotly with the help of seaborn
6)  Encoding
7)  Logistic Regression with the help of sklearn
8)  Then Model Building (train & test)
9)  Confusion Matrix
10) After all these things I create a DashBoard
11) DashBoard is helps to data visualization
